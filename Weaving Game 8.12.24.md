Utilizing the full community intelligence, and through the game, we can level up the awareness in the field of who is doing what. 


Benevolent Communitty Collusion

Roots to Fruits:
> When we nourish the roots, we will naturally create ripe fruits.
> If we dont focus on the GOAL or PURPOSE then naturally we will have fruits come of it.
> > “Just be friends!

Ramzy:
KEEP IT SIMPLE. KEEP IT ORGANIC
We are all humans who love to eat, who love to dance
NO NEW WHEEL IS NECESSARY

Our target:
People who want to belong
and people who want other people to belong
> cant just have superconnectors, you need amplifiers, etc. to have a healthy composition
> > Need mediators to the energies

Friendship ROIOTED in meaningful intention
Let’s tend teh right kind of roots so that the fruits may grow

We need better tools for the collaborating gathering space

Remind people that there is home without solid ground

What is it to be Rooted in Boulder
> Sharing the cultural imprint of what Boulder is cultivating.
> So that even when we are traveling, that we can cross pollinate the essence of this place 
> What experiment do we want to be creating in Boulder, to contribute to the collective web?

The games are: Everyone trusting each other more
* creating saftey, then destroying it, then doing it again and again
* building trust that the web will hold you
* Disturb peoples trust sop that you can build it
	* Deandre has plenty of games to destroy and build trust
	* Instead of leaving home and trying to find another
		* I am being SENT FORTH into the world, and I will always have a home (here) aka Boulder
		*
